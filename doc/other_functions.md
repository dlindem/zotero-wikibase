# Other functions of the zotero-wikibase tool

## Import entities from Wikidata to your Wikibase

This function enables you to import entities (items, properties) from Wikidata to your Wikibase in a few clicks.
* You can choose the languages you want labels, aliases, and descriptions to be imported
* You can import import statements describing the entity, as long the Wikidata property is aligned to your local equivalent property.
  * We encourage you not to massively import statements, and make use of [federated queries](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikibase/Federation) instead.
  * Statements pointing to items (properties of datatype `WikibaseItem`) are excluded from this function in the current version.
